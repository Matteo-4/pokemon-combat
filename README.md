Pokémon Battle - README
Description
Pokémon Battle is a game where two trainers battle each other with their Pokémon. Each player can choose actions such as attacking, switching Pokémon, or using items during their turn. The game is turn-based, where each player's actions affect the state of their Pokémon and the outcome of the battle.


Key Features
1. Select an Attack
   During their turn, a trainer can choose an attack from the available moves of their active Pokémon.

The attack deals damage to the opponent's Pokémon and may have special effects depending on the type of the attacking and defending Pokémon.

2. Switch Pokémon
   A trainer can switch their active Pokémon with another living Pokémon from their team.

This may be necessary when the active Pokémon is knocked out (KO) or when a strategic change is needed.

3. Use an Item
   During their turn, a player can use an item from their bag. For example, a "Revive" item can bring a KO'd Pokémon back to life and heal it for a portion of its health points.

Items are limited in quantity and are consumed upon use.

4. Opponent's Turn
   The opponent (either AI or another player) will take their turn automatically by attacking, switching Pokémon, or using an item based on the state of the game.

5. KO Management
   When a Pokémon is KO'd, it is removed from the battle. The player must then choose another living Pokémon to continue fighting.

If all of a trainer's Pokémon are KO'd, the battle ends and the other trainer wins.

6. Graphical User Interface
   The game uses a graphical interface to display battle messages, allow players to select actions, and visualize the Pokémon's status during the battle.

Buttons allow players to interact with the game, choosing an attack, switching Pokémon, or using items.
